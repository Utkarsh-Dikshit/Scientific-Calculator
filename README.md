# Scientific Calculator
It is a versatile console based application.

This versatile tool handles arithmetic computations, calculates trigonometric values in both radians and degrees, converts between binary, octal, decimal, and hexadecimal number systems, evaluates logarithmic expressions, and even tackles quadratic and cubic equations.

# For Future
As you can see this code is not optimized and not so good as I have built it during my initial learning phases.
So I will try to make it a lot better application in the future.
